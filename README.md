by: lovenus

Version: 1.2.1

A Loader used to load custom DLLs into the game.

Instructions:
The DBGHELP.DLL must be placed in the same folder as GGXXACPR_Win.exe 
and any mod that requires it should be placed under a Mods folder 
that you must create yourself (that also has to be in the same folder 
as GGXXACPR_Win.exe, NOT inside Resource).
